Some kids were rollerblading and a few were walking their dogs or doing their morning jogging. The place is clean. The stone chairs under the trees are nice, maybe good for resting or reading a book. There are also a few chairs on the sides along the path. I appreciate it that the pavement to walk along or follow is also wide.

Spacious enough to hold at least 300-500 people at the middle of the park and there's still good space at the perimeter sides. Children were playing by the 2 slides. Some kids were rollerblading and a few were walking their dogs or doing their morning jogging. The place is clean. The stone chairs under the trees are nice, maybe good for resting or reading a book. There are also a few chairs on the sides along the path. I appreciate it that the pavement to walk along or follow is also wide. The sun rises from the Rada street's direction, a sight to see between buildings.\n\nIf you want a touch of nature while in the area, this is a good place to stop by.",

I understand if it is for the safety of the people, but at least make it at least 3ft and not 5ft. So that we can still enjoy view. I know why some of the people stay at the sumilang bridge instead at park. Hoping that this will not happen on the other linear parks too",

If you're going to swimming pool, or visit the mini A-maze, butterfly House, Boat Ride, and Flower fields, there is a separate charge, which is only P10-P50.\n\nAround the year 2012, the zipline was P500 for one zip. Unfortunately, it is closed indefinitely.\n\nThere is a mini-zoo, such as monkey and ostrich.\n\nThere are gazebos to rest in.\n\nThey have refreshments inside the park, from mini-donuts to ice cream.",

          "text": "Those who are new to hiking may opt to climb this mountain. Not only is it close to Manila but the trail here is so easy one will not get lost. There were actually groups of teenagers without guides climbing with us. Plus, it is not too steep and there is actually a rough road that enables vehicles to climb this preferably motorcycles, mountain bikes, and 4x4 cars. Those who also can't wake up early in the morning should also opt for this mountain since the view here in the afternoon is exquisite. Yes, it may be unbearably hot as one climbs it around 1PM but, along the way, there are sari-sari stores who sell snacks and drinks. Do stop by for a refreshingly cold buko juice that's just PHP 10. Most important in climbing it in the afternoon is that the mountain becomes picturesque. There are spots that look like you're in Africa while some are similar to Batanes's grassy lands that look superb during golden hour. Best of all, as you climb down, there is a chance for you to see both the sun and the moon in appearance. The sun in the left horizon and the moon in the right horizon. That was what we were able to experience here. It was a rare sight! Well, that was according to my friend who has already climbed a lot of mountains. En route to the summit, one will get to pass by a barren spot which allegedly became a shooting location for a Philippine historical film. Other reasons to climb this is that there are picnic tables with a good amount of shade and a camp site where one can put up one's tent. Sleeping overnight here will enable one to star gaze and simultaneously see the city lights from a distance.",

Although at first I felt nervous for I heard tragic stories and confirmed it by searching through goggle about this place . but because I'm an adventurous person I set aside my worries and become excited about so many things I'm going to witness.\n\nWe arrived in Batangas late night already so we start trekking about 8pm. We start our silent journey up with manong (our guide) on the lead and I followed. The trail is narrow and small rocks are hindrance for it rolls beneath our shoes everytime I step on it ,  cause my body to sway a little and I had to stop for a while to regain my balance. Sometimes i  open a conversation with manong guide asking him about his life being a guide and he said his job is his only bread and butter, he send his two children to school that's why his job being a guide is very precious to  him , good job manong!  We rest everytime we stumbled a tree or a hut ,  good thing the moon shines in full so we don't need our flash light anymore for the moon shines brightly upon us.  After so many hours of trekking we arrived at the camp site at last !famished . so,  we eat first before we assembled our tent and after a while we rest for the night.\n\nWe start our journey towards the Rockies at 6am, manong guide told us before we rest the night to wake up early so we will be able to see the foggy morning view of taal lake. And yes! it's worth the hardship of climbing those risky Rockies .the views from we're I was is awesome i can't believed i witnessed this breathtaking scenery ...i thank's GOD I'm with the this people and in this beautiful place that God created.",

The coffee was clean and fruity while the ice cream was unlike any I have tried before, icy and yet has a great creamy mouthfeel, not to mention the sweet strawberry.

As we approached the entrance, we noticed the cafe's aesthetics and welcoming atmosphere. We ordered the \"Intramuros\" (Manager's Choice) pizza and Carbonara Pasta, along with Slush Kiwi, Matcha Latte, and Caramel Macchiato.\n\nThe food was good, but when considering the taste and price compared to other cafes, I felt it was a bit on the expensive side. In my opinion, the food's flavor was ordinary and nothing special about it. The drinks we ordered were too sweet, so it's advisable to inquire about sugar levels when ordering.\n\nAdditionally, the cafe was a little bit crowded, which I think was because we visited around lunchtime. I also observed that the food was served in plastic containers, which differed from the images on the menu that showed the dishes on plates. It's important to note that bringing outside food to this cafe is not allowed. On the positive side, the staff were friendly and approachable. The cafe is air-conditioned and offers free Wi-Fi and power outlets, making it a suitable place for studying.",

From all the carrot cakes I’ve tried, this one is the least sweet. I was really surprised of how it doesn’t taste sweet compared to other carrot cakes. I also tried the oreo cheesecake from my sister and I love that one too!\n\nThe cafe has a second floor (where we stayed) and has a different vibe from the cafe below. The ground floor has a modern and hippie vibe but at the 2nd floor, it’s more chill and quirky.",

They had a buy 2 take 1 promo when we went there, so we got dirty matcha. The dirty matcha was good but I like the latte one better. They only have two sizes which is like, enough to be honest. Afterwards we heard that matcha was sold out and we were so lucky we got the last ones. Pain au chocolat is alsoooo amazing although mej makalat kami haha.

Kaya siguro 3 star kasi noong pumunta kami walang kuryente okay lang naman  sa amin yon. Naligo kami tapos noong magbabanlaw na walang tubig saka lang kami masabihan na kapag walang kuryente di din gumagana yung pump ng tubig. Kaya naghintay kami ng 2 hours para bumalik ang kuryente ulit. Wala silang maoffer na alternative. Sana pinaghahandaan nila yung mga ganong moments. Nakaka disappoint.",

Close proximity to the Underground River made it sound like we avoided a lot of waiting to go thru the cave - essentially turning a somewhat full day trip into simply a pleasant morning adventure.

Everything we had was really flavorful, and prices were very reasonable, though a bit more pricey than “living like a local”, but certainly in line with what one should expect at a nice establishment in this area. They even had live entertainment both nights during dinner which created a nice evening vibe. There were plentiful activities on site - beach with hammocks for relaxing, pool, reading cottage, small gym. Bungalows were cozy, clean and offered good amount of space. We enjoyed listening to the sound of the crashing waves outside front door as we were falling asleep.",

Maybe the location hampers the tourist to visit this place.\nFortunately, our visit coincided with the high tide so it’s much easier for the boats to dock. We walked almost 50 meters along the walkway until we reached the entrance of Liyang Cave. We approached the lone caretaker and we paid PhP20 for environmental and maintenance fee. Since some of our companions already went here, they also served as our tour guide.\nLIPUUN POINT RESERVATION\nThe Tabon Cave complex is part of Lipuun Point Reservation, which has the size of 138 hectares and connected to the Palawan mainland via an isthmus and mangrove forest. The National Museum is currently tasked to protect and preserve the reservation. Rich in cultural and natural resources, the area was declared a Site Museum Reservation on April 11, 1972. The reservation is protected by the national government as a museum reservation to protect the caves and immediate vicinity from deforestation and to preserve the cultural artifacts present there.\nLIYANG CAVE\nThe Liyang Cave is the first to go so we wandered around here. It has big chambers and bright lights outside. Cave openings are also visible from the shore. Markers were installed about the stone flakes as well as the flora and fauna in this site including the Palawan hornbill, balinsasayao, tabon bird, binuang tree and extinct deers.\nTABON CAVE\nAs we exited the Liyang Cave we went up the stairs leading to a cave – the Tabon Cave. It is said to be the Philippines’ Cradle of Civilization. It is also the largest cave in the entire Lipuun Point Reservation. According to the marker, the chamber is 41 meters long, dry and bathed in sunlight throughout the day. These ideal features explain why the ancient man chose Tabon Cave as a dwelling place for at least 50,000 years ago. The earliest human remains in the Philippines known as Tabon Man was recovered in this cave. The recent study shows that the remains are 47,000 years old. But it’s a little bit disappointing as the site is littered with cement bags.\nTABON BIRD\nDuring our wandering we noticed one bird that is said to be the cave’s regular visitor, and where the cave’s name was derived from – the Tabon bird or the Philippine scrubfowl. They often stay on the ground but will fly away at a short distance when disturbed. True to its word, it digs out sand, bat droppings or guano, or soil to build their nests, lay its eggs, and cover them. As the eggs hatch, the chicks will come out from the mound. The word Tabon in Filipino means to cover.\n\nSITE RULES AND REGULATIONS\nIn order to protect and preserve the reservation, all visitors must strictly observe the following:\n- No hunting, disturbing and handling of any animal from the reservation.\n- The destruction and removal of any plant from the natural habitat are strictly prohibited.\n- No littering of any waste.\n- The destruction and collection of objects of natural beauty such as corals and limestone are not allowed.\n- No vandalism.\n- No damaging of trails.\n- Artifacts cannot and must not be removed from the caves.\n- No altering, removing or defacing boundary marks or signs.\n- Animals not native to the reservation may not be introduced at any time.\n- No removal and harvesting of forest products.\n- No bringing of food and eating along the trail.\nNote: The manunggul jar artefact is now under the care of National Museum of Anthropology",

There you pay 200 pp for either a kayak or a boat and 100 pp for the environmental fee. Our friends rented snorkels for 100. They gave us a discount for 4 people which was very nice. Honestly I would recommend getting the boat, since it comes with a captain/guide who takes you to a cave/”lagoon” and 4 really cool snorkelling spots. One of them is a colourful big clam garden! Other than that our highlights were a turtle, barracuda, bat fish and lots of light blue hard coral. Super colourful and healthy.\n(Maybe ask to see barracuda point, since I only found out about it later and we didn’t go there.)\n\nHave fun 😍",

We stayed 4 hours with a boat which was amazing and just enough and paid 50/hour additional for the boat. There is a little street food window. Overall it was 650 pax for the whole trip. Gregory and his son were our boat drivers.\n\nReefs are the most colorful we have seen but they are dying as well. Maybe 20% was alive. We have seen turtle and lots of Nemos:)",

The underground river, also known as the Puerto Princesa Underground River, is a remarkable natural wonder that boasts limestone formations, unique flora and fauna, and a captivating underground river system. Exploring the river on a boat tour is a must-do experience that allows visitors to witness the awe-inspiring beauty of the cave and its surrounding environment.\n\nApart from the underground river, Puerto Princesa offers a range of other attractions and activities. Honda Bay, located just a short distance from the city center, is a popular destination for island-hopping tours, snorkeling, and swimming in crystal-clear waters. The nearby islands of Snake Island, Pandan Island, and Starfish Island offer picturesque landscapes and vibrant marine life.\n\nNature enthusiasts will also enjoy a visit to the Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center, formerly known as the Crocodile Farm. Here, visitors can observe various species of crocodiles, as well as other wildlife, including endemic birds and reptiles. The center plays a vital role in the conservation and rehabilitation of endangered species.\n\nPuerto Princesa is also renowned for its commitment to sustainable tourism and environmental conservation. The city has implemented several initiatives to protect its natural resources, including the mangrove forests and the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its exceptional marine biodiversity and diving opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the city offers a range of accommodations, from luxury resorts to budget-friendly guesthouses, along with an array of dining options that showcase local Palawan cuisine.\n\nOverall, Puerto Princesa is a paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers.

The crocodiles, civet cat, and Philippine porcupines are housed in rather tiny enclosures. I hope they can work on improving their living spaces for these animals.\n\nIt's important to note that getting to Calauit Safari is a bit of a journey, nearly a 2-hour drive from Coron town proper.

The water is so clean you could see the sea bed.\n\nThe beachfront itself is maintained by Eagle point so there is a 200 php entrance on the area.\n\nGetting there is also quite expensive as you would have to get a boat ride from Mabini to the island itself.\n\nDo not forget to bring your own food as there is no food avaialable in the area. Ihaw ihaw tho is available .You do need bring the food tho.\n\nThere's a relatively clean and maintained restroom in the area. And there are tables and chairs you can rent.\n\nThe sand is a bit gritty so aqua shoes are recommended.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience for those who want to snorkel and be away from the city.",

Something they should give a deep thought of for their paying customers.\n\nI would suggest to bring your own stove, cooking utensils, pots and pans, plates and cutleries. They have free use of grilling station, first-come-first serve. Bring your own comfy camping chairs and table coz you have to rent their table and chairs too.\n\nI would also suggest to bring what you need before entering coz stuff inside are pricey from rice, sodas, foods, Ice cubes etc...",

Yes, their pools are nice, and the sunset and view are beautiful but the beach water is not good, especially when it rained (it rained every night during our stay), the water in the beach is brown and leafy. There are no nearby outside restaurants so if you didn’t bring food to cook, you’ll be stuck eating in their restaurants. The food on both their restaurants - Lagoa and Pico Restaurants and Bar is expensive and not worth your money because it doesn’t taste good. And the service in Lagoa is BAD. Takes too long to prepare food, employees like chitchatting, they don’t go to your table to get orders unless you call them, and seems like they can’t handle more than 20 people in their restaurants. The rooms are owned to different people, so it depends on the cleaner of the owner on how clean your rooms will be. My family stayed in Myna A 109, the rooms is clean, it has water in the dispenser, it has refrigerator - the wire shelf in the freezer though was rusty, and the beds’ mattress are thin and cheap I can feel the frame when lying down. And the mattress and pillows are stinky, like they have been wet and were not dried properly. And the water in our bathroom was dirty. It was light brown even after running. I would post a photo of the water but no option to attach a photo in this review. So all in all, it’s not worth it going here!",

However, the resort itself was very mediocre and very overpriced for the quality, we got an overpriced air bnb for a night which was fine, as the hotel had no rooms left. We got a wristband that you need to keep on which was very frustrating to constantly have a ribbon on your wrist.\n\nThe beach was okay bar some patches of rubbish floating around in the sea. The biggest disappointment was the food, the restaurant had some of the worst food and pizza I’ve ever tasted. It took 40 minutes to get it and it’s basically just a pizza someone threw together and put in an electric oven. If you’re going to market yourself as a classy resort at least have some decent food available. Let one of your restaurants to a decent franchise if you’re not going to put in any effort yourself into creating above very sub standard food. I was delighted to finally be leaving after spending a day there.\n\nAlso very classless to have review botting for your ratings. Improve your resort and maybe you will not need to artificially increase your rating score. Those profiles are clearly fake if you look at them and all come within the same hour of each other posting.",

We got a wristband that you need to keep on which was very frustrating to constantly have a ribbon on your wrist.\n\nThe beach was okay bar some patches of rubbish floating around in the sea. The biggest disappointment was the food, the restaurant had some of the worst food and pizza I’ve ever tasted. It took 40 minutes to get it and it’s basically just a pizza someone threw together and put in an electric oven. If you’re going to market yourself as a classy resort at least have some decent food available. Let one of your restaurants to a decent franchise if you’re not going to put in any effort yourself into creating above very sub standard food. I was delighted to finally be leaving after spending a day there.\n\nAlso very classless to have review botting for your ratings. Improve your resort and maybe you will not need to artificially increase your rating score. Those profiles are clearly fake if you look at them and all come within the same hour of each other posting.",

It's safe to swim because your feet can still touch the sand even if you're far from the shore and the waves are not that big.

If you're at the beach camp don't expect too much. The way going there is steep and rough road. Don't bring a lowered car and going there at night is not recommended. When you arrived at the destination, you have to go down a staircase with more or less than 30 to 50 steps. The kuyas and the security guard are helpful in assisting you to bring your stuff going down to your designated villas. Some villas are already old and dilapidated. But the villa we stayed in is still good. The cooking appliances and utensils are complete some of them still have a tag price. During our stay, the electricity was cut twice but only for a brief second. We ran out of water supply on our third day but after we reported it, the water flow was back. If you're bringing your kids make sure you have something to put or apply on them to prevent mosquito bites because there are a lot of them. Overall, I enjoyed the beach and sand it's not white but powdery with no pebbles it's way better than galera and will give it 4 stars. Room and service is 2.75 to 3. Location is 2.",

You will definitely feel very close to nature. The accommodation is okay, considering the location but definitely could have been better. The toilet cum bathroom was okay with running water at all times. The free breakfast provided in the morning was okay too. The room we booked was good for 4 people but they allow up to 10 people to sleep there. Extra bedding is available on request and additional charges. The beach itself was not so impressive. We did take a dip in the ocean but I have seen and been to much better beaches. Also, because of the weekend, it was very crowded. I would not prefer going back.",

The modern and stylish lobby immediately impressed me upon arrival, and the check-in process was efficient and friendly.\n\nThe room I stayed in was spacious and well-maintained, featuring contemporary decor and comfortable furnishings. The bed was particularly comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep. The in-room amenities, including a flat-screen TV and a well-stocked mini-bar, were appreciated.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were diverse, and I enjoyed several meals at their restaurant. The food quality was commendable, and the staff provided excellent service.\n\nOne area where Seda Vertis North Hotel could improve is in-house recreational facilities. Although they have a pool and a gym, these areas felt a bit limited in size.\n\nNonetheless, the staff throughout my stay were attentive and courteous, always willing to assist with any requests or inquiries.\n\nIn summary, Seda Vertis North Hotel is a great choice for travelers looking for a comfortable and stylish stay in Quezon City, with convenient access to the vibrant Vertis North district. While there are some areas for improvement, my stay was enjoyable, and I would consider returning on my next visit to the area.",

The showers without curtains turned bathroom time into an unintentional group bonding activity. The food situation was a joke - not enough and what they had was just absurd. Maintenance? Forget about it. The elevator moved at a pace slower than a snail, and the facilities were a visual representation of neglect. The bed was a backache waiting to happen. If you're planning a trip, steer clear of this disaster zone.",

The windows with water stains. It looks like they don't even bother cleaning the rooms after a guest has left. I didn't bother changing hotels because I had an important event to go to and I can't even cancel my booking anymore. The hallways and elevators smell like a really really old, wet book (and not in a good way). There were flies everywhere, including the lobby where the buffet was set. I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like. 🤢 Now, it's been three days after I left and I'm still suffering from rashes due to the nasty beddings. I think it had bedbugs. I have been to other hotels and cheap stays with the same price range and I can tell you that this has been the worst experience ever.

It is hard to call the housekeeping for assistance. We even called 2-3 follow ups to the frontdesk before someone send our request. You should have a very long patience and waiting time before you get served. The staff will not attend you immediately especially when you are a local tourist. You can feel the isolation of foreigner and local from the staff in the frontdesk to the staff in the penthouse. They are also letting the intern assist the guest without proper supervision and giving an incorrect information to the guests and the managers were not even apologetic with their mistakes. Lastly the frontdesk even ask the guard for other checkout and parking policy which is not appropriate. A frontdesk staff should know better than other staffs because they are one welcoming and the first and last touch of the guests.\n\nFood - Complimentary breakfast buffet is not ok. The egg is not fresh, full of fried and process food, less selections, nuggets, chicken longganisa and everyday arroz caldo serving which is very bland. Coffee is a bit acidic, hot choco taste like ovaltine with milk and not a real tsokolate as expected. Fruits were dry and sweet ham is a bit chewy taste like it was thawed from the freezer for couple of days.\n\nRoom - 1st night the beddings were a bit itchy, the towels were a bit grayish, we ask for a slippers but the frontdesk advise that it is not included in the accomodation and you need to pay for extra 35 pesos each person to have one. First time to hear that in a hotel accomodation. No laundry bag and they only give us a trash bag since their supplies for the laundry bag is not available. The light is quite din in the nights time no center white light for the night. We requested for a city view but we end up a view beside the LPU roofdeck. We also need to request for our toiletries. On the 2nd day they did not refill the hand towels.\n\nOverall our stay is not worth it for money even for the experience and surely we will never come back. This is one of the overated hotels posted online",

          "text": "Stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding of a friend.\n\nCheck in - security personnel were very polite in assisting us from drop off to the parking space even reserve the parking slot when we advise that we are staying for 2 nights and we are worried if we can still have a slot if we go out to go to the church and come back for the reception since the frontdesk advise that it is a first come first serve basis in the parking.\n\nLocation -  the hotel is near the gate of intramuros and it is easy to take a tour go to other places which is very accessible even if you take a public transport\n\nStaff - upon check in we ask for an assistance to carry our luggage but the staff who assist us just bump our bags in the wall in the cabinet and we end up helping him out instead. It is hard to call the housekeeping for assistance. We even called 2-3 follow ups to the frontdesk before someone send our request. You should have a very long patience and waiting time before you get served. The staff will not attend you immediately especially when you are a local tourist. You can feel the isolation of foreigner and local from the staff in the frontdesk to the staff in the penthouse. They are also letting the intern assist the guest without proper supervision and giving an incorrect information to the guests and the managers were not even apologetic with their mistakes. Lastly the frontdesk even ask the guard for other checkout and parking policy which is not appropriate. A frontdesk staff should know better than other staffs because they are one welcoming and the first and last touch of the guests.\n\nFood - Complimentary breakfast buffet is not ok. The egg is not fresh, full of fried and process food, less selections, nuggets, chicken longganisa and everyday arroz caldo serving which is very bland. Coffee is a bit acidic, hot choco taste like ovaltine with milk and not a real tsokolate as expected. Fruits were dry and sweet ham is a bit chewy taste like it was thawed from the freezer for couple of days.\n\nRoom - 1st night the beddings were a bit itchy, the towels were a bit grayish, we ask for a slippers but the frontdesk advise that it is not included in the accomodation and you need to pay for extra 35 pesos each person to have one. First time to hear that in a hotel accomodation. No laundry bag and they only give us a trash bag since their supplies for the laundry bag is not available. The light is quite din in the nights time no center white light for the night. We requested for a city view but we end up a view beside the LPU roofdeck. We also need to request for our toiletries. On the 2nd day they did not refill the hand towels.\n\nOverall our stay is not worth it for money even for the experience and surely we will never come back. This is one of the overated hotels posted online",

Unfortunately, our stay was marred by the rude and unprofessional behavior of the part owners of Room 1711.\n\nShortly after we checked out, we received a call around 2-3 in the morning from Ivan, one of the part owners, regarding the used beddings. According to him, we were not supposed to use the clean beddings reserved for the next guests. However, upon check-in, Ms. Janel Esperanza, another part owner, explicitly informed us that we could use the items inside the cabinet, including those in the rattan basket.\n\nThe beddings in our room were filthy, so we decided to change them. Unfortunately, there were no available beddings inside the cabinet, only in the rattan basket. We used the beddings from the basket, unaware that they were intended for the next guests. If we had known, we would not have used them. It is common sense to assume that we should replace dirty beddings, right?\n\nTo make matters worse, during my conversation with Ivan, another part owner in the background started shouting and rudely interrupted us. This person even had the audacity to point at me and insinuate that I needed to be shouted at. Is this how professionals handle situations with their guests? I think not.\n\nWhile we understood that the accommodation was affordable, we did not expect to be treated with such disrespect and unprofessionalism. The behavior of the part owners, especially towards their guests, was completely unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, our experience at Azure Urban Resort Residences was disappointing due to the rude and unprofessional conduct of the part owners of Room 1711. We hope that the management takes appropriate action to prevent such incidents from happening to future guests.",

This person even had the audacity to point at me and insinuate that I needed to be shouted at. Is this how professionals handle situations with their guests? I think not.\n\nWhile we understood that the accommodation was affordable, we did not expect to be treated with such disrespect and unprofessionalism. The behavior of the part owners, especially towards their guests, was completely unacceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, our experience at Azure Urban Resort Residences was disappointing due to the rude and unprofessional conduct of the part owners of Room 1711. We hope that the management takes appropriate action to prevent such incidents from happening to future guests.",

          "text": "Winford Manila is our go-to hotel and the hotel we’ve visited the most in the last couple of years. There’s just a lot of things to like about the hotel.\n\nThe location is great. It’s right in front of SM City San Lazaro so it’s easy to just cross the road over to the mall if you need anything or if you want to go for a quick food run. Speaking of food, the hotel breakfast is one of our favorites. They have a good selection of food that’s actually delicious. Room service was also pleasantly reasonably priced. Other hotels have annoyingly high prices for room service but here it’s quite reasonable. You still have an option to get something delivered through Grab or go to SM to eat if you want to eat cheaper.\n\nSpeaking of cheaper, make sure to check their Facebook page for promotions. They usually have big discounts on rooms so make sure to check before booking. The rooms are priced well to begin with so even if you don’t get a discount, you’re still getting a bang for your buck.\n\nThe staff are generally attentive, helpful, and friendly. They’re also very accommodating if you need anything. Security guards probably need a bit of training, I’d have to say. But they’re not bad. Just not as overly friendly as other hotel staff.\n\nWhat we like the most is probably the heated pool. I’d like to emphasize this one, they have a heated pool! Imagine going for a nice relaxing swim at night. This is something you should try if you haven’t experienced it already. And the pool is not hot, it’s relaxingly warm. Makes me want to go back just thinking about it. One more thing, the pool is intelligently designed where there's a shallow area at the side of the pool so adults can still enjoy swimming even when they're looking after their kids. It's just brilliant!\n\nBy the way, if you’re concerned about the casino and you’re planning to stay with children, don’t worry. The casino area is totally separate from the hotel. You won’t even know there’s a casino unless you look for it. And even if you do find it, your kids won’t be able to enter anyway.\n\nOverall, we highly recommend the Winford Manila hotel to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, convenient, and affordable place to stay in Manila. The service is excellent, the food is tasty, the facilities are superb, and the location is ideal. It is definitely one of the best hotels in Manila.",

Especially for guests who have been waiting at the lobby for 2 hours already! But no! They have no sense of customer consideration at all! In other hotels that I've been to, although their check in time is 2PM, they will be considerate with waiting customers at the lobby and will let me check in earlier (some at 1PM even!).",

The separation of buildings didn't help either. The first building, which housed Dotonbori, was a two-story structure with clothing brands and restaurants inside. On the second floor, there was a way to reach the second building. The open spaces were filled with restaurants. If you went beyond that, you could see the second building. It had three floors, and in front of it was a platform surrounded by even more restaurants. Lastly, the grocery store was located at the very end or, depending on your perspective, at the start, as it was quite abundant.

There are many establishments here, such as banks, a Starbucks, Koomi, and an Anytime Fitness on the fourth floor.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 3 stars is purely because of the incredibly tight basement parking. The ramp entering the basement parking, as well as the ramp connecting basements 1 and 2, are extremely narrow and tight, on top of being steep. Not only that, the vehicles going up or down use the exact same space. So for those who are inattentive (not that I defend such, it can just happen at times), you may end up in a bit of a situation if you go up or down the ramp the same time as a car going the opposite direction. Perhaps the worst part of it is the turn-in of the ramp from basement 1 to basement 2. For those who drive larger and wider vehicles like I do, it can be a nightmare to get through that part each time without unnecessarily scraping the sides of your car. In my case, unless I have all the room to maneuver in that area in some instances, I would just barely make it through and have the right rear wheel go up the yellow floor divider that ramps usually have. I read an older review here and I would have to totally agree. Hopefully they can manage to widen that particular part of the parking, because it has been a problem for many who have been there prior, as clearly shown by all the scratch marks seen on the walls.The fact that it is free (from my experience) only slightly offsets the tightness of their basement ramps (especially that horrendous turn-in from basement 1 to 2, I cannot emphasize this enough).",

All Bathroom have toilet rolls  which is a plus,most of the shopping center doesn't provide any toilet paper. You will be lost  walking around on this Mall, very clean and all staff including the security guard from the department store are very helpful. I love walking around specially earlier, when it's reached the peak hours the place are so hectic, jostling with people coming in. Food court are huge but still hardly finding the table to sit on. There's a lot of options anyway, restaurant is a big hit as well. Love this Mall and highly recommended instead going to small one. But mind you theres a lot of SM mall around but this one is my favs amongst all.",

If they realize you're a foreigner, they might try to charge you a higher price. However, there are some sellers at this place who are quite honest and don't mark up their prices. Also, be cautious of thieves; I received a few warnings before going there. Overall, though, you can find a wide range of items at this place at reasonable prices.",

At least dito sa Vista Mall may free parking.\n\nOne thing that I like here is their supermarket, na I believe open 24/7 and it's also pet-friendly. That's a big deal for me.

Rooms were clean and you can tell that the hotel is pretty new. Especially by the smell. The bed was also comfy and I had a good rest. No water problems either. From other reviews saying noise about construction may vary based on where you are located. We stay at room 915 and had no construction noise inside our room. But if you go to the swimming pool you will experience near by noise based on that they still doing construction in that floor. The swimming pool is not that big and not that deep either so keep your expectations low. It comes with a gym also, for people who like to exercise. The best part about the hotel is that it is next to BGC so you can just walk around to all the places you wanna go to. The only bad thing that I experience so far at the hotel was that one night the wifi was really not good, this was on a Saturday. This could be because of overuse of the internet. So be prepared for it to happen during the weekends. But in conclusion I will definitely stay here again when I am going to BGC again.",

First, it’s really close to SM Aura (2 min walk) which is a great mall for all your needs - food, cafes with wifi to work, supermarket, fashion etc. Plus there’s a 7-11 right beside the hotel lobby, so there’s never an issue with basic things you’ll need.\n\nBut most importantly, the staff here are amazing. They might technically be a 3-star hotel but the staff here definitely hold themselves to a 5-star standard. Even the guards go out of their way to look out for you and make sure you get in and out of your cars/entrances safely with zero hitch. Special shout-out to Joe who was looking out for me the whole time I was there, making sure I could get to places quickly and safely. I felt really looked out for! Which was important for me as a solo female traveller.\n\nThe rooms and facilities are simple, clean and good, not luxurious by any means but good enough plus things are new. Tv connected seamlessly to Netflix. Wifi was great. I only heard very light construction sounds once during my stay, didn’t affect me at all.\n\nFor the price, the stay was extremely worth it!\n\nThis will be my go-to when I’m in Manila in future.",

          "text": "My recent stay at Wynwood Hotel Manila was an experience that perfectly blended modern sophistication with urban flair. Located in the heart of the bustling city, this hotel offers a stylish and comfortable stay for both business and leisure travelers.\n\nFirst impressions matter, and Wynwood Hotel Manila didn't disappoint. The lobby exuded an air of chic elegance, featuring contemporary decor and inviting seating areas. The check-in process was swift and efficient, with the staff greeting us warmly and providing all necessary information about the hotel's amenities and services.\n\nThe room we stayed in was spacious and tastefully decorated, boasting a minimalist design that radiated a sense of tranquility. The plush bed ensured a good night's sleep, and the room's cleanliness and attention to detail were commendable. Additionally, the panoramic city views from our window were a delightful sight, especially during the evening when the city lights lit up the skyline.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were satisfactory, though I felt there could have been a wider range of choices on the menu. The breakfast buffet offered a decent selection of both local and international dishes, ensuring a satisfying start to the day. The on-site restaurant had an inviting ambiance, though it lacked some of the flair and variety I had expected from a hotel of this caliber.\n\nWynwood Hotel Manila does shine in terms of recreational facilities. The rooftop pool area was a definite highlight, providing a cool and relaxing retreat amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. The gym was well-equipped with modern exercise machines, perfect for those who wish to stay active during their stay.\n\nOne aspect that stood out during our stay was the exceptional customer service provided by the hotel staff. From the concierge to the housekeeping team, every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful, and attentive to our needs. They were knowledgeable about the local attractions and were more than willing to provide recommendations for dining and sightseeing.\n\nThe hotel's location is also a major advantage, being within walking distance or a short ride from popular shopping districts, cultural landmarks, and entertainment hubs. This convenience allowed us to explore the vibrant city easily and make the most of our stay in Manila.\n\nHowever, one minor drawback was the occasional noise from the nearby streets, which might be an issue for light sleepers. While the hotel itself is well-insulated, the sounds of the bustling city occasionally filtered into our room.\n\nWynwood Hotel Manila offered a chic and comfortable stay in a prime location. With its modern aesthetics, friendly staff, and convenient amenities, it's an excellent choice for travelers looking for a stylish urban escape. While there is room for improvement in some areas, the overall experience was enjoyable and would undoubtedly entice me to consider staying at Wynwood Hotel Manila again in the future.",

They were being defensive and kept on pushing the lie that we had been informed before booking a room.

However I called the front desk and raised our concern to them, and they accommodated our request and transfered us to the room that we were really expecting. So, good customer service on their part!\n\nThe breakfast buffet is superb! Cafe Miranda has a very good and welcoming staff. They are attentive to our needs and offer foods that are to our liking.\n\nThe location is very convenient as well. They have free parking but be sure to be fine with parking on the sidewalk.\n\nAnd a little tip, if you're the type who drinks a lot of water, then I suggest that you bring your own! We tried calling room service to request for more water and they told us to try calling Cafe Miranda instead to request for service water because they only replace the complimentary water once a day. So, we called the restaurant and they only gave us one glass of cold water. We had to go to the 7/11 nearby to buy a large bottle of water.\n\nBut overall, it was still an enjoyable and a pleasant stay. We'll give it a 4/5 stars!!!!",

The lobby was not too comfortable.\n\nWe were in the hotel for an activity. Food served was not that impressive and the function room was too cold and bit dim lit. We stayed in that function room for two days.\n\nThe room OK, but LOVE their bed and pillows --- so COMFY!!! However, the TV cable service is not too impressive --- too many channels that are not included in their subscription, and they didn't have a TV channel list so you don't have an idea which channel is ok and you are forced to channel surf to find something to watch.\n\nRestaurant is open til 11pm only. Tried their pizza, it was GREAT! I forgot the name of the pizza though, sorry.\n\nLocation is in the middle of the busy Manila business district of Mabini-Ermita area. The road is quite narrow, so expect lot of traffic, but there are a lot of business establishments around.\n\nIn general, the staff were fine.",

And the old rooms only have a very old shower over bath which looks like it came off Noah's Ark.\n\nI complained them was subsequently moved to the so-called renovated area where there has been a lick of paint added but still the furnishings original old outdated furnishings.\n\nThe bathroom hand basin has terrible water pressure it is just a trickle, and the toilet handgun is the same with very poor water pressure and the toilet doesn't flush properly.\n\nThe only positive thing I could say for this place was the shower as it has a high pressure shower head with good water pressure nothing else in this hotel is up to standard.\n\nThe Wi-Fi is very poor quality and regularly cuts out and they have a very small old LCD TV with a reasonable selection of English speaking channels.\n\nThe swimming pool area is unsightly and the water in the pool is cloudy and disgusting and I'm sure you would get there or I infections if you did swim in their terrible water.\n\nThe lifts feel unsafe as they shake and there is no air conditioning or fan inside the lifts they are hot, stuffy old and grubby\n\nI would not recommend this hotel to anybody there are too many far better properties at cheaper prices or similar price in the area.\n\nMy overall impression is this hotel needs to be demolished and something new rebuilt in its place it is well past its use by date it is not comfortable and it is not worth the money.",

And the old rooms only have a very old shower over bath which looks like it came off Noah's Ark.\n\nI complained them was subsequently moved to the so-called renovated area where there has been a lick of paint added but still the furnishings original old outdated furnishings.\n\nThe bathroom hand basin has terrible water pressure it is just a trickle, and the toilet handgun is the same with very poor water pressure and the toilet doesn't flush properly.\n\nThe only positive thing I could say for this place was the shower as it has a high pressure shower head with good water pressure nothing else in this hotel is up to standard.\n\nThe Wi-Fi is very poor quality and regularly cuts out and they have a very small old LCD TV with a reasonable selection of English speaking channels.\n\nThe swimming pool area is unsightly and the water in the pool is cloudy and disgusting and I'm sure you would get there or I infections if you did swim in their terrible water.\n\nThe lifts feel unsafe as they shake and there is no air conditioning or fan inside the lifts they are hot, stuffy old and grubby\n\nI would not recommend this hotel to anybody there are too many far better properties at cheaper prices or similar price in the area.\n\nMy overall impression is this hotel needs to be demolished and something new rebuilt in its place it is well past its use by date it is not comfortable and it is not worth the money.",

          "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND Richmonde Hotel to all people I will meet.. Checked-in October 13, 2023 evening at Room 2203. The Front Desk did not give instructions on how to use the elevator using the room key card. October 13-14, the cold shower knob was a bit loose thread though there was water running through and I was able to use it. However, on October 15 at 11am, I was balancing the hot shower with cold shower and I was able to wet my hair and body, had shampoo and soap. Suddenly, the cold shower knob was fully loose thread and no cold water running through, only hot shower was functional. I got out of the bath tub and used the bidet to rinse my shampooed hair and body soaked in soap. I phoned the reception and spoke to Miss Shanice or Shania, the Duty Manager. All she can do and say was to apologize and report to maintenance. I did not feel the sense of urgency on how she handled my concern. We checked -out at 1pm, I did not feel sincerity nor personal touch in pacifying an inconvenienced customer. Very poor customer service. I regret that I gave an overall excellent rating for Richmonde Hotel done on October 14 when I was handed the survey form while having my breakfast at the dining hall. Your maintenance department is not doing a good job performing routine checks.",

The bed was very spacious (it could easily fit three people) and comfortable. The airconditioning was just right (not super cold or warm). Check out was fast and efficient. Elevator service was also fast, and the guard at the entrance was nice and polite. Greatly appreciated the water dispenser by the elevators and the soap dispensers (good sustainability features).\n\nHowever, the soundproofing of the room was not very good -- one could easily hear the noise from the halls (although the sounds from the adjacent rooms could not be heard). There were small cockroaches in the room, especially in the sink area -- I was able to kill about 7 of them during my stay and just ignored the others. I usually sleep with the lights turned off, but because of the cockroach problem, I had to sleep with some of the lights on for fear of some of them crawling on me while I was asleep. There were some spaces in the 4th floor that had a random piece of wood propped up, which made the whole space look untidy and unprofessional. There was only one person manning the reception counter at 8pm, so check in took some time (not a very good experience if one just came from a whole day of tiring travel).\n\nAll in all, okay for just one night's sleep.",

Drinks and snacks at the cafe seemed overpriced. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant was so-so.\n\nDinner service at the restaurant was non-existent. We arrived for dinner very early; we were the only diners at the time. Two hours later not a single dish had been served and there were also several other guests already waiting for their orders as well. We ended up canceling our order and dining elsewhere.\n\nOverall, location and rooms are excellent for a few nights stay. Skip their food service.

The minimalist interior design of the rooms is perfect for rest and relaxation, not to mention the lovely view of Taal lake from the balcony.\n\nStaff was courteous and helpful, very responsive to our needs.\n\nMy only complaint were the cafe and restaurant. Drinks and snacks at the cafe seemed overpriced. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant was so-so.\n\nDinner service at the restaurant was non-existent. We arrived for dinner very early; we were the only diners at the time. Two hours later not a single dish had been served and there were also several other guests already waiting for their orders as well. We ended up canceling our order and dining elsewhere.\n\nOverall, location and rooms are excellent for a few nights stay. Skip their food service. For a hotel supposedly managed by Enderun, it was quite disappointing.",

It does not have any Taal Volcano view since it's on the other side of the road but I would say it has a good room, accommodating service and relaxing location. If you're coming from Sta. Rosa exit of Calax, it would be around 45 minutes to get there without any traffic along Tagaytay mainroad. Arriving at the place, there is a security check point where you need to provide your valid ID. I also discovered that they also have some those renting and owned units so I don't know the review there. (Maybe some time). For the hotel stay experience, it was beautiful. We arrived late but there's an available front desk for check in. There's also a lot of covered parking spaces. There were also elevators to take us in our rooms at 3F. Rooms have their own air conditioning units, TVs, heater at the washroom (Please revisit all equipment if working well esp for room 302) and some complimentary items. When we booked via Booking, we didn't get with the free breakfast, however it didn't hold us to have a good meal beside the hotel (less than 20 steps from the main door) to start the day. They have very limited choices but it was nice since it was a good deal. There's a swimming pool and forest facilities though I didn't try to swim and explore. Hoping I can be back for another good hotel experience.\n\nTo add they have function rooms and outdoor space. Contact them to get the details.",

Not only did this raise health concerns, but it also made us question the hotel's cleanliness and maintenance practices. The shower also had drainage issues and emitted an unpleasant odor, making it an uncomfortable experience.\n\nIn addition to that, we encountered insects in the room and noticed a lack of proper cleaning upon check-in, which was disappointing (there were dead insects by the window, live insects flying around, and some sort of film on the tiled floor).\n\nAnother letdown was the wine served during our stay. Both the red and white wines were unpleasantly aged and undrinkable.\n\nTo make matters worse, we reached out to the hotel asking for the manager's email a few days ago to express our concerns, but regrettably, we received no response, leaving us feeling ignored and disheartened.\n\nJet-lagged and exhausted from a 25-hour flight, we should’ve reported these instances immediately. However, after seeing such positive reviews when booking this hotel, we expected a higher level of service and cleanliness. Unfortunately, our experience fell short, and the unresponsive management further compounded our disappointment.\n\nWe hope this review will prompt the hotel to address these issues and improve their guest experience.

Trust me, any pet friendly hotel is better than this one.\nBelieve me, this hotel is currently the worst pet-friendly hotel I have ever stayed in. We booked a pet-friendly double room for 6000 plus per night, which is close to 7000p per night, but when we checked in, he temporarily informed us that pets would cost extra even though they charged extra.  They pay for pets but they are not friendly to pets at all. They don’t even provide drinking water for pets.\n\nWe spent nearly 7000p. The lake view room we booked turned out to be a connecting room at the end.\nThe hotel was under construction and close to the road. It was very noisy.\nThe door lock was broken.\nThere was a thick layer of ash in the bathroom.\nThere was no one-time service provided by a star-rated hotel.\nToiletries, bed sheets and duvet covers are not new.\nOnly 2 bath towels are provided. The toilet paper is not new and has been used by others.\nThe floor at the door is bulging and it is very difficult to open the door.\nThe TV does not have any channels. When it comes to breakfast, it is very annoying because we have a small dog, so we chose  Sitting outside on the lawn there was no service at all and we were not even given napkins and later I found out there were no people around with dogs and they were all served water a range of services only us no cutlery no service water and after we had just finished and were ready to drink coffee  When the waiter came over very eagerly to take away our plates and cutlery, I thought they were replacing new cutlery for us, but they did not collect the cutlery. I hope we hotel guests will leave quickly. The buffet feels like a lot of leftover food from the night before.  It’s not a new hotel. Except for poor facilities, poor service, poor hygiene, and expensive price, it can’t even compare to the island hotel where I went to surf. For the most honest review, please see the picture.",

I am with my brother and my sister. The staff told me that \"Tatlo pala kayo? Akala ko dalawa lang kayo. Hindi kayo pwede kung tatlo.\" And we asked why since we are willing to pay for the additional head naman and we are all siblings then the staff replied \"Dalawa kasi lalaki. Kung dalawa sana yung babae tapos isang lalaki pwede pero hindi pwede kapag dalawang lalaki tapos isang babae\".\n\nCome on we are siblings, we already presented our IDs but the staff is insisting that only two girls and 1 boy can stay. After that one, we spoke with a supervisor and raised our concern. They already allowed us to stay.\n\nThen after a few minutes we got a call from the awful frontdesk. She was asking about the money that I gave the staff. We were discussing about the additional head and she asked me that I gave a \"2500 deposit\" then I aswered no. What I gave the staff is the payment and they never asked for a deposit. But that rude lady on the phone told me, \"yung 2.5k po na binigay niyo is yung deposit niyo po\" then I replied, \"ay sorry po, bali yung 2.5k ko po kasi is yung payment po for the room and I didn't consider it as a deposit kasi di ba po ang deposit is makukuha niyo po once you checked out?\" She replied, \"payment and deposit is the same thing po. Ang gulo niyo po kausap (With a rude tone of voice).\" Like what? I know there are times na magkakaroon ng misunderstanding thru the phone with the management and customers but then that is not the correct tone and response that you should be using while you are having a conversation with your customers. Malay ko ba na magkaiba kami ng definition ng payment and deposit? 😏\n\nAnyways, I don't recommend this hotel. Find another one who will treat you better and make you feel important.",

As we returned to our room after the long fun day of hotel activities (cooking demo, parlor games, scavenger hunt, & movie night), there was an unexpected knock at the door, and to our delight, we were presented with a kiddie nightcap: a glass of milk and a set of Oreos for each of our kids. It was an incredibly thoughtful gesture that made our evening extra special.\n\nThat was after dinner - savoring a mouthwatering dinner. We had Beef Bulalo and crispy pork belly, which were expertly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and truly exceptional.\n\nThe room itself was cozy and beautifully designed, providing a peaceful retreat for our family. The attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel was evident, from the kid-&-pet friendly amenities to the impeccable cleanliness.\n\nOn top of all the wonderful experiences, the hotel has HEATED pools. With Tagatay’s cold weather, the ability to take a refreshing dip in a warm pool added an extra layer of luxury.\n\nIf you're looking for a place that goes above and beyond to ensure your family's comfort and happiness, this is the perfect place for you.

It is time the hotel should change their sheets pillow cases and towels if not have them bleached to be clean. The food does no taste good. Do not try their longanisa, its awful. Their rice was a bit hard as well  i requested for an extension cord but never got any feedback nor the extension itself. The only good in this hotel is its location.

The showerhead looks as if it has never been cleaned since time immemorial. The sheets pillow case and towels are so disgusting as they are no longer white but yellow. It is time the hotel should change their sheets pillow cases and towels if not have them bleached to be clean. The food does no taste good. Do not try their longanisa, its awful. Their rice was a bit hard as well  i requested for an extension cord but never got any feedback nor the extension itself. The only good in this hotel is its location. If you can tolerate dusty and dirty showerhead you can survive a night as I did in this hotel. Bottom line enter this hotel at your own risk hehe.if you can avoid this place better do",

But when other customers came, they assisted them much better than us. They served them as if their money is different from our money. Even the AC was turned off. We were wearing worked clothes at that time. A field uniform that was not fancy but clean. And they looked at us as if we didn't have the capacity to pay what we ordered. That's the worst experience.  But after I paid them with my card, they were so polite to say thank you when we left the premises.

Portion size, serving time, and ambiance were all okay, as you'd expect from a casual dining spot. The taste of the curry was good, but I wasn't expecting potato 🥔 in the chicken curry, and the roti turned out to be a South Indian appam, not the wheat bread I anticipated. Ordered a Pakistani roti afterward, and it was more like a pita bread.\n\nIt's an average place for a quick lunch, with nothing particularly authentic from the cuisines they claim to serve.",

Just the right amount if pineapple dressing. The goat cheese was really good.\n\nThe mushroom soup was creamy and really filling.\n\nThe dry pasta tortellini with three cheese filling was the best. Pasta was cooked al dente and it was soooo good. I just wish it to be more citrusy. Maybe a fresh lemon on the side will do the trick.\n\nThe dessert we got was a blondie with mallows, Bailey’s, and salted caramel. It was good but too sweet for my liking. It was a nice ender.\n\nFor the beverage, we got a glass of grape bellini mocktail. It was refreshingly good. Must try.\n\nLimited parking space but they have a valet service.

It's a sprawling green oasis in the heart of the city, offering plenty of space for everyone to unwind. We found various spots to sit, chat, and reminisce about old times. The lush trees and well-maintained lawns provided a refreshing break from the urban hustle and bustle.\n\nFor those interested in history, the Quezon City Memorial Circle also houses the Quezon Memorial Shrine. The monument is an impressive tribute to the first president of the Philippines, Manuel L. Quezon. We took some time to explore the museum inside the shrine and learn about Quezon's contributions to the country's development.\n\nAnother great aspect of the memorial circle is the availability of various outdoor activities. We rented bicycles and rode around the park, enjoying the fresh air and scenic views. There are also picnic areas where you can bring your own food and have a leisurely lunch amidst nature.\n\nOverall, our visit to the Quezon City Memorial Circle was a rejuvenating experience. It's a perfect getaway for groups of friends or families seeking a break from the city's hustle. The park offers a serene ambiance, recreational activities, and a touch of history, making it an ideal destination for anyone looking to destress and spend quality time with loved ones.",

I was in the \"detention room\" which is a tucked away man cave with perhaps the widest range of whisky, brandy and rums I ve seen in Manila. The owner himself is a great host and loves talking about drams while we sipped on some Arran 18 Scotch. Only downside if you are gluttonous kinds while drinking alcohol, then there are no food options.

I was in the \"detention room\" which is a tucked away man cave with perhaps the widest range of whisky, brandy and rums I ve seen in Manila. The owner himself is a great host and loves talking about drams while we sipped on some Arran 18 Scotch. Only downside if you are gluttonous kinds while drinking alcohol, then there are no food options.

We stayed until closing and orders kept on going until last call.  One staff (maybe the owner?) attended to us and it went perfectly well. Drinks and food came out timely, no errors nor missing orders, attentive and highly knowledgable of their products. Commendable skills! 👏🏽By far the best service I've ever experienced in the PH.\n\nDrinks are creatively done and they definitely don't skimp on the alcohol content, not watered down. Food is also remarkable. Definitely get the one with the mushroom dip and the pizzas.\n\nIf youre driving, parking may be limited right out front but you can park on 14th Street close to the corner.",
